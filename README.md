# Repository for Linear Multilevel Bayesian Regression Selection: Comparing Three Predictive Information Criteria 

- `data/` contains the raw data from each (144) simulation cells and scripts to parse these data.
  - `raw_data/` contains the raw `.rds` files
  - `conds_with_var.csv` is the design matrix. 
  - `fits_summary.rds` is the summarized output from `raw_data/`, parsed using `parse_output_nested.R`
  
- `figs/` contains figures generated by `main.R`. Should be self-explanatory.
- `out/` contains output generated by `main.R`.  Should be self-explanatory.
- `run_CC/` contains scripts that ran the simulation on the [Compute Canada's Beluga cluster](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Getting_started)
- `supplemental` contains supplemental analyses, such as the scripts and results from the small parameter recovery study ran to confirm that simulated data was correct. See main text for more information. 
- `main.R` runs the main analyses reported in the main paper on the summarized output, `fits_summary.rds`.
