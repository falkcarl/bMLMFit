# Repository for *Comparing the Accuracy of Three Predictive Information Criteria for Bayesian Linear Multilevel Model Selection*
 

- `run_CC/` contains scripts that ran the simulation on the [Compute Canada's Beluga cluster](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Getting_started)
- `studyX` contains all data and code for studies 1 and 2. Within:
  - `data/` contains the raw data from each (144) simulation cells and scripts to parse these data.
    - `raw_data/` contains the raw `.rds` files
    - `conds_with_var.csv` is the design matrix. 
    - `fits_summary.rds` is the summarized output from `raw_data/`, parsed using `parse_output_nested.R`
  - `figs/` contains figures generated by `main.R`. Should be self-explanatory.
  - `out/` contains output generated by `main.R`.  Should be self-explanatory.
  - `mainX` contains the R code to analyze the data. 
- `supplemental` contains supplemental analyses, such as the scripts and results from the small parameter recovery study ran to confirm that simulated data was correct. See main text for more information. 
- `customcodeexamples` contains custom stan code to illustrate conditional and marginal estimation of MLMs
